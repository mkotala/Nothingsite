      <p><strong>The Game</strong> is a <em>mental game</em> where the objective is to avoid thinking about The Game itself.<br />
        Thinking about The Game constitutes a loss, which must be announced each time it occurs.</p>
      <p>It is impossible to win most versions of The Game.</p>
      <p>Depending on the variation of The Game, the whole world, or all those aware of the game, are playing it all the time.<br />
        Tactics have been developed to increase the number of people aware of The Game and thereby increase the number of losses.</p>
